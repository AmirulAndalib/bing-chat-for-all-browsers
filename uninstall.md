# Give Me One More Chance!

### Most people fixed their problems with the following quick fixes:

- Clear the cache and cookies on bing.com.
- Whitelist bing.com if you have any Adblock or VPN.
- Firefox Users, you **must** use version 110 or up! Please update your browser.
- Or sometimes just refresh a couple times! Microsoft rushed their release, and it's still buggy.

### If you have many extensions:

- Disable all extensions except this extension.
- Clear Cache & Cookies on Bing, and freshly login to Bing.
- Once you check that your Bing Chat works, you can re-enable all extensions again.

## Known Regional Locks:

- Bing Chat is not available in China. [Link](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/new-bingsorry-looks-like-you-no-longer-have-access/6d21c57f-0484-4a9a-a9ac-c46c706722cc)
